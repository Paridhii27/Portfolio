            <p>Move A Bit is a live motion capture project created during the Quantum Design Jam at The New School with IBM. The project brings the concepts of quantum computing to life through a fun and interactive experience. It visually showcases the concept of entanglement through the interaction of the viewer with the system.  Just as a special correlation exists between qubits, the particles in Move a Bit have a special relationship with the subject in motion. Quibit is the basic  unit in quantum computing into which quantum information is stored/ encoded.  In this project, movement produces the quantum state with all quantum possibilities represented in different colors. Stillness represents the observed collapsed, classical state.</p>

    Do you ever feel that youâ€™re floating above ground with no gravity to bring you down ? <br>
    At the end of the day does it feel like flying or like falling through the sky ?<br>
