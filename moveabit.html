<h1>Move A Bit</h1>
<p>
    Did they tell you that there’d be days when you felt like you were flying and days when the world felt like you were falling through the sky <br>
    As life passes you by in a blur <br>
    Moving so fast that you gasp for air  <br>
    Like you can’t feel your hands and legs <br>
    Do you ever feel that you’re floating above ground with no gravity to bring you down ? <br>
    At the end of the day does it feel like flying or like falling through the sky ?<br>

<p>Move a Bit is a live motion capture project bringing quantum to life through an interactive display that visually showcases entanglement. Just as a special correlation between qubits exists, the particles in Move a Bit have a special relationship with the subject in motion. Movement produces the quantum state with all quantum possibilities represented in different colors. Stillness represents the observed collapsed, classical state.</p>
