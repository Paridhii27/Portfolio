<h1>Move A Bit</h1>
<p>
    Do you ever feel that youâ€™re floating above ground with no gravity to bring you down ? <br>
    At the end of the day does it feel like flying or like falling through the sky ?<br>
</p>

<p> Exhibited at the Microscope Gallery for the Quantum Art exhibition organised by IBM and The New School </p>

<p>Move a Bit is a live motion capture project bringing quantum to life through an interactive display that visually showcases entanglement. Just as a special correlation between qubits exists, the particles in Move a Bit have a special relationship with the subject in motion. Movement produces the quantum state with all quantum possibilities represented in different colors. Stillness represents the observed collapsed, classical state.</p>
