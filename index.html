                Your imagination keeping you awake<br>
                in the middle of the night<br>
                Is it fantasy or is it just blatant lies<br>
                Does imagination ever turn into reality <br>
                Is there some truth always hidden in fantasy? <br>
                Do you ever feel like you’re floating away from real life? <br>
                Does it feel dreamy or scary at times ? <br>

                Did they tell you that there’d be days when you felt like you were flying and days when the world felt like you were falling through the sky <br>
                As life passes you by in a blur <br>
                Moving so fast that you gasp for air  <br>
                Like you can’t feel your hands and legs <br>
                Do you ever feel that you’re floating above ground with no gravity to bring you down ? <br>
                At the end of the day does it feel like flying or like falling through the sky ?<br>
