            <h2>Warped memories of digital ghosts</h2>
            <p> This project welcomes you to a world in which people go to a data store to access their digital memories in the form of differently flavoured cookies. Each cookie tells the person about some particular aspect of their life making the person question how digitally vulnerable they can be and how twisted is the idea of data monopolisation.</p>
