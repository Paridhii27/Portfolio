        <p>“Computerized memories” is a project that explores the biological
          structure and psychological character of memory.</p>

      Our memories are the accumulation of a lifetime of experience and in this sense, 
      our memories are who we are. These memories consist of the places, people, and things
      we interact with in our day to day lives. The project begins with a scene
      of a desk, there are pictures on the wall reflective of a person’s past
      experiences. There are objects on the desk, notes, headphones, and other
      things the person finds themselves using on a day-to-day basis. So now
      when we think about the memories of a computer, how is a computer forming
      its memories? Delve into the computerized memory world to find answers to
      your questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are four scenes. The first scene introduces you to the protagonist
      of this world, the computer. The scene depicts a person's rooms and her
      tactile memories and then you enter into the computer's memories.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      As we start to delve into the computerized environment. There are four
      main themes related to the memory functioning of the mind according to
      cognitive neuroscience research which are visualized in this project
      Connection Compartmentalization Cognition Consolidation Each of these
      concepts is explored through the outlook of a computer.
    </p>
    <div>
      <img src="/Images/computerized/6.png" />
    </div>
    <p>
      The first scene inside the computer takes the user through a journey of
      traversing a field of cubes which is reflective of the idea of memory
      storage in a computer. The memory is depicted as unnamed cubical modules
      distributed randomly throughout the environment. Using python code and
      random variables the scene is created to visualize the theme of
      compartmentalization. This theme notes how memory can be localized to a
      particular area of the brain.
    </p>

      <img style="width: 90%; height: auto" src="./Images/computerized/7.png" />
    </div>
    <p>
      Now the second computerized memory scene explores the theme of connection.
      “A phenomenon of brain cells is that memories are instantiated by
      alterations of the strength or reliability of communication between cells
      via their synaptic connections. This scene recreates the circuit
      connections within a RAM of a computer. Each section of the RAM is formed
      using fractals to create the circuitry. The project also reveals itself in
      bits and pieces as you enter and exit portals.
    </p>
    <div>
      <img style="width: 50%; height: auto" src="/Images/computerized/8.png" />
    </div>
    <p>
      Finally, the last scene of this interactive experience explores the
      concepts of cognition and consolidation of memories. The computer forms
      memories when it interacts with the user through applications. The
      computer employs audio functionality when the user opens Spotify and plays
      a song. The computer searches across the internet when the user asks a
      question on chrome. The computer remembers blender and unity 3-d
      functionality when those applications are started. So, would the computer
      be able to do any of that if it didn’t have a memory of it? This goes into
      the psychological aspect of memory analysis. It also talks about the theme
      of consolidation which is how memories take permanent form. The experience
      ends kind of abruptly looking at the control center of the computer:
      settings. Leaving an imprint or trace in the mind of the user at the end.

      “Computerized Memories” is a fictional immersive environment exploring the
      connection between human cognitive memory functions and computer memory
      structures. As data has now become inherent in every aspect of life from
      navigation, health, weather and just about everything else, we need to
      question how do we distinguish what is computerized and what is human?
      With AI, computer’s memories are becoming more and more realistic. Are we
      losing part of ourselves to the computer? How far will this go? Are we
      starting to forget who we were when there was no computer? What is our
      digital trace on the world?
