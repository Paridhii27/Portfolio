        <h1>Two kinds of Love</h1>
        <p>
          It delves into the story of two people living in the future who send
          each other postcards because they can’t see each other. The inherent
          systems of the society at the time have created physical barriers
          between them.

          It's the year 2065. The world’s environment has deteriorated many
          folds. A suffocating blanket of smoke is covering the land. Based on
          your status in society, you are either left to die in the smoke and
          heat or you get access to the revolutionary AI at the time to create
          an altered reality for you where you’re living in a utopia.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two people who send each other postcards because they can’t
          see each other. The inherent systems of the society at the time has
          created physical barriers between them. One of them comes from a well
          off family while the other person barely has anything to keep them
          alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on this storyline, we started to develop the world of our
          characters. Asking questions like, How do the characters know each
          other? How long have they known each other? What is the conflict/ is
          there one? Where does each character live? “Why is one place
          considered utopian?Why is the other place considered dystopian?
        </p>
        <p>
          After determining what we want the story to be, the next question was
          about how we can translate all that information in the form of
          postcards. How many postcards should we make? What is the last
          postcard? How does the tone change and the narrative arc develops as
          time goes by? Where are the characters situated when they send
          different postcards? Since we wanted to create visual scenes of each
          postcard's environment we divided them into categories. There are
          three postcards each from both of the characters and one anonymous
          postcard at the end which the viewer can interpret as being sent by
          any one of them. There is warmth, love and conflicts intertwined in
          these postcards.

        Lastly, the project was compiled as an archive book with the postcards
        interspersed with pressed flowers, leaves, images and an artifact. Some
        of the postcards have a qr stamp on them which takes you to the website
        which has the embedded environments. It conveys the difference between
        reality and altered reality because all the pictures the girl sends are
        dreamy and imaginative while the video shows the blunt truth of the
        world as flashbacks as the girl blinks.

        The songs tiny dancer by Elton John and Unknown/Nth by Hozier were used
        within this project.
