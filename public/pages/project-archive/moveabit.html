        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This project was created during the Quantum Design Jam at The New
          School with IBM. The project brings the concepts of quantum computing
          to life through a fun and interactive experience. It visually
          showcases the concept of entanglement through the interaction of the
          viewer with the system. Just as a special correlation exists between
          qubits, the particles in Move a Bit have a special relationship with
          the subject in motion. Quibit is the basic unit in quantum computing
          into which quantum information is stored/ encoded. In this project,
          movement produces the quantum state with all quantum possibilities
          represented in different colors. Stillness represents the observed
          collapsed, classical state.We are entangled with the system.
        </p>

        <h2>Generating quantum data</h2>
        <div class="image-flex-container">

        <p>
          To generate the quantum data to guide the properties of our motion
          reactive particles, we used the W-state to entangle three quibits.
          W-state is a means of entangling 3 quibits robustly especially when a
          quibit is lost. The quantum circuit was composed of reset, RY, CU and
          controlled-x gates. The circuit also had three measurement info or
          z-basis at the end to measure the quibit values in the classical
          register. We chose to work with 3 quibits because we wanted the
          quantum data to guide the RGB color values of our particles.
        </p>
        <h2>Generating particles</h2>

        <p>
          The quantum data was then put into touchdesigner: a node based visual
          programming language for real-time interactive content. The data had
          to first be formatted so that it could be put into the RGB ramp in
          touchdesigner to control the colour of the quantum particles. Since
          the values of the RGB columns were entangled, it created a limited
          color palette. The particles that aren’t of the original colors are a
          demonstration of noise, or quantum computation errors. Essentially as
          you move, the particles of the quantum system move with you. The
          project only exists in correlation to the viewer.
