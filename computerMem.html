    <h1>Computerized Memories</h1>
    <p> “Computerized memories” is a project that explores the biological structure and psychological character of memory. Our memories are the accumulation of a lifetime of experience and in this sense, our memories are who we are. These memories consist of the places, people, and things we interact with in our day to day lives. The project begins with a scene of a desk, there are pictures on the wall reflective of a person’s past experiences. There are objects on the desk, notes, headphones, and other things the person finds themselves using on a day-to-day basis. So now when we think about the memories of a computer, how is a computer forming its memories?
        Delve into the computerized memory world to find answers to your questions.
