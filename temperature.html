    <p>
      According to research published on the National Library of Medicine
      website under the title of “The Temperature of emotions”, there is a close
      correlation between emotions and temperature through embodied processes.
      We can see evidence of this in the way we tend to describe emotions
      through the language of temperature. Feeling warm or heartwarming is often
      associated with happiness and the feeling of being content. Being cold
      with someone or chilled with fear on the other hand often has negative
      connotations. Emotional temperature is implicitly and explicitly seen in
      many aspects of our life. This research went into the subtilities of these
      findings to understand how emotions and temperature are related
      cognitively. The research on this concept is still scarce but they found
      out that the region of hypothalamus in our brain which is responsible for
      maintaining the body’s internal balance does so by regulating temperature,
      through a process of homeostasis. Emotions are homeostasis responses to
      maintain our body’s internal balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further,” the theory of constructed emotions suggests that emotions are
      categorizations of past experiences molded by embodied knowledge. Emotions
      do not come from specific brain structures, rather the brain creates them
      as concepts by parsing sensory information, affect and physiological
      changes.” The brain triggers these responses depending on the way
      different sensory inputs and physiological processes are interpreted which
      is closely tied to the process of homeostasis.

      For my project I created a temperature change visualizer using physical
      computing. There is a DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor attached to a
      8x8 dot matrix. I wanted the device to be able to sense a change in
      temperature when a person holds the sensor in their hand. The device
      simultaneously shows a color visualization of the measured temperature.
      The temperature is reflective of the heat index (saturation and hue) of
      the colour and the humidity gives us the alpha or blur of the colours.
      This was a project built to visualize the concept of the temperature of
      emotions. Colours are a means of reflecting these emotions in the device.
    </p>

      This project came with a lot of challenges in terms of the compatibility
      of the DHT11 temperature sensor with the LED matrix. I studied many
      different temperature sensors and got a sense of how they worked by the
      end of it. The DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor features a
      temperature and humidity sensor complex with a calibrated digital signal
      output.
